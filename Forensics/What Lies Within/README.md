## Problem Statement
> Theres something in the [building](buildings.png). Can you retrieve the flag?
## Hints
> There is data encoded somewhere, there might be an online decoder
## Solution
When we see that there is data hidden in an ordinary file, the first thing we would think of is steganography. Steganography is a technique where a message can be hidden in the bits of a file. Using an online decoder such as [stylesuxx's decoder](https://stylesuxx.github.io/steganography/) we can find the hidden flag.
## Flag
