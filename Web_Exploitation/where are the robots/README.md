## Problem Statement
> Can you find the robots? `https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/47235/` ([link](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/47235/)) or http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:47235
## Hints
> What part of the website could tell you where the creator doesn't want you to look?
## Solution
Once we open the link, we are greeted with a seemingly basic website. The title of the problem suggests to look for a `robots.txt` file. A `robots.txt` file is a text file that blocks automatic web robots from running. A common mistake people make is they put secret information in files listed in the `robots.txt` file. When we look for this file by going to `https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/47235/robots.txt`, we see this list:
```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /54e98.html
```
By going to `https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/47235/54e98.html`, we finally see the flag.
