## Problem Statement
> This secure website allows users to access the flag only if they are admin and if the time is exactly 1400. `https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/12276/` ([link](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/12276/)) or http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:12276
## Hints
> Can cookies help you to get the flag?
## Solution
This is just another simple cookie manipulation. Unlike logon where we change a cookie, this time we have to add 2 cookies. We can inspect element and go to the Console tab. From there, we can use `document.cookie = "admin=True"` and `document.cookie = "time=1400"` to create the cookie values and set them to exactly what they need to be. From there, we should be able to access the flag through the site.
