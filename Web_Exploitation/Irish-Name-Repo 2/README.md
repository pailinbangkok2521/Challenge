## Problem Statement
> There is a website running at `https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/14912/` ([link](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/14912/)). Someone has bypassed the login before, and now it's being strengthened. Try to see if you can still login! or http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:14912
## Hints
> The password is being filtered.
## Solution
This site looks a lot like the one from Irish-Name-Repo 1, yet once we try this same SQL Injection of `' OR 1=1--` here, we get nothing but a page that says SQLi detected. After some playing around, we can figure out that the filter detects several keywords, including `UNION` which was the solution for last year's SQLi filter challenge. However, after some blind SQLi, we bypass the filter by setting the username to `admin'--` and the password to whatever. We are guessing that the username here should be admin and then commenting out the rest so that the password is not checked. The SQL query behind the scenes would probably look something like this:
```sql
SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username='admin'--' AND password='';
```
Note how everything after the -- comment is not no longer considered to be part of the query.
